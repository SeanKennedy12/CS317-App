                            <p class="ParagraphText" id="two">With this app, we can all work together to improve the land around us while getting fit, finding new places and meeting new friends.<p>
                            <p class="ParagraphText" id="three">To start, simply sign up for a free account on our <a href="Register.html">register page.</a> or, if you already have an account, <a href="SignIn.html">sign in</a> to use the app.<p>
                            <p class="ParagraphText" id="four">Once you have your free account, its time to get social! Join the <a href="Chat.html">chat</a> and meet fellow [INSERT APP NAME HERE]ers and hop onto the <a href="Map.html">map</a> to find nearby locations that YOU can help to clean up.</p>
                            <p class="ParagraphText" id="five">Once you've had a chance to search around the app, its time to start cleaning up! Select a location on the map that has a garbage problem, designated by a red or orange marker colour, and head out.</p>
                            <p class="ParagraphText" id="six">Keep in mind, this is a chance to keep healthy and meet new folks. So go somewhere you've never been before, maybe somewhere out of your way, and use the chat to set up a cleanup meetup!</p>
